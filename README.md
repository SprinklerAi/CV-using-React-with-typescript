This is meant to be demonstration of my past and present skills and a project-based learning for me. Going to be updates as I improve.

First commit on 25.11.2025:
Added a placeholder appbar, applied custom palette to theme, created grid container that has draft of timeline cards for events (either life events or my projects) and next to it description.

Implemented new features:
- AppBar
- Grid
  - Timeline grid is inside bigger grid that holds timeline and description. It transforms into horizontal scrollable in xs and md size, and is vertical in xl.
