This is meant to be demonstration of my past and present skills and a project-based learning for me. Going to be updates as I improve.

NOVEMBER 27th 2025:

I have learned:
- Read Material UI guidelines. https://m2.material.io/design
- Read Majority of Material UI component and customisation documentation. https://mui.com/material-ui
- Watched "React JS 19 Full Course 2025" by Jacvascript Mastery (2h). https://youtu.be/dCLhUialKPQ?si=jh8Ut_FrKbZlspPF
- Watched "TypeScript in React" by ByteGrad (1h). https://youtu.be/TPACABQTHvM?si=hTGVuH_uJTyfdtso

First commit on 27.11.2025:
Added a placeholder appbar, applied custom palette to theme, created grid container that has draft of timeline cards for events (either life events or my projects) and next to it description.

Implemented new features:
- AppBar
- Grid
  - Timeline grid is inside bigger grid that holds timeline and description. It transforms into horizontal scrollable in xs and md size, and is vertical in xl.

Second commit:
- Timeline consist of cards that alternate left right and art going down vertically when screen size is large, and turn into horizontal scroll when screensize is md or xs.
- Changed colors a bit, but those will be finished only in the end.
- Card texts for timeline are not hardcoded mostly now, they can easily be localised thanks to i18next dependency.

What's next:
- Timeline interactiveness
  - Cards are gonna be clickable which will bring up relevant more in debth on what now is placeholder text.

- Second page about life events like for work, education etc instead
- Navigation to that page.
